Module 1 Challange: Code Refactoring
User Story:
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

Acceptance Criteria:
In this project we were given the task of refactoring, or correcting, some existing code given to us.
The first thing that needed to be fixed was the anchor tag for the 'Search Engine Optimization' link so it would bring you down to that article once you pressed it.
 Our next task was cleanign up what is commonly referred to as the "div soup", which is when you repeatedly use the div tag making the code very difficult to read and sjust makes itflow akwardly. 
 I did that by using a few different semantic tags, namely including; article, aside, and nav. Using the nav tag for the navigation links at the beginning, the article for the bulk of the text and the aside for the side text.
 Our image elements needed to have accesssible alt attributes as well. 
 We also needed to make sure that our heading attributes fell in sequential order.
 We also needed to change the title to something more descriptive, I just changed it to match the name of the sample company used in the project. 
CSS selectors were also asked to be consolidated and organized to follow the semantic structure, while being commented throughout.
